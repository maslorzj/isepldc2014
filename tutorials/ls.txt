						"ls" COMMAND
				==============================================

<<<<<<< HEAD
 The ls command is used to display files and subdirectories which are in the current directory
 Example : 
 		Home: ~>ls desktop
 result :
 		Documents Music Videos Images mongoDB
  
 
 =========================================================================================================

 						Some flags
 						--------------
 							
 	-1 : displays result in columns

 	-F : add an indicator at the end of the file/folder name to give more information about its type
Example : mongoDB@ is a symbolic link.
 	  Documents/ is a folder.
 	  mongoDB* is an executable file.
  
	-s : shows the file's size

	-L : only used with symbolic links.
Used to show informations about the file which is pointed by the symbolic link.

A file is defined among others by its name and its content (called "inode").
Two type of links between files can be found.

=========================================================================================================

						Hard links
 						-------------

Allow you to have two files with a different name but the same inode (so the same content).
This can be usefull when two programs have to use a same file.

When the content of a file is modified every file with the same inode will be modified too.

To create a hard link :
				ln nameFile nameNewLinkFile

=========================================================================================================

						Symbolic links
						 -----------------
						
Symbolic links can be compared to shortcuts on windows.
By this way, it can be quicker to access a file.
It avoids us to always rewrite the same path to a file which can be sometimes quite imposing.

To create a symbolic link :
				ln -s /path/to/file /path/to/symlink

Example :

Home: ~>ln -s Documents/Images img   :   will create an "img" folder on "Home, symbolic link of the Images folder.
