equivalent du php preg_match() ?

files="*.jpg"
regex="[0-9]+_([a-z]+)_[0-9a-z]*"
[[ $f =~ $regex ]]
name="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
echo "${name}.jpg"    # concatenate strings
name="${name}.jpg"    # same thing stored in a variable
done
Edit: It's better to put the regex in a variable. Some patterns won't work if included literally.

This uses  =~ which is Bash's regex match operator. The results of the match are saved to an array called $BASH_REMATCH. The first capture group is stored in index 1, the second (if any) in index 2, etc. Index zero is the full match.

a='name:lalaname:lili';echo $a;regex='name';[[ $a =~ $regex ]];
